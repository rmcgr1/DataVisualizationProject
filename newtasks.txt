New Goals:

    Clearly label the X and Y axes with which ratios are being represented
    Gradation colors based on T/TT faculty to non T/TT faculty
	(If possible) allow for animation of data over time


UI Fixes:

First digit of salary is cut off on y axis
Tooltip does not show if datapoint is on far right of scatterplot area
Legend for mean, median lines
Draw medan, media lines only until the axis
