New Goals:

    Clearly label the X and Y axes with which ratios are being represented
    Keep the denominator the same for both axes (have only one selection area)
    Align the option to select year and option to select denominator on same side
    Represent the various schools of study by shapes instead of color
    Remove the 'Space Available' numerator option
    Replace 'Research Funding' to 'Average Faculty Salary' and range values from $75k-$150k
    Calculate the line for mean, in addition to median, and display both. Color each one and make a key to distinguish them.
    Double check the data to make sure it is accurate. Some things did not display how they should (example, comp sci appears to be very small)
    Gradation colors based on T/TT faculty to non T/TT faculty
	(If possible) allow for animation of data over time
